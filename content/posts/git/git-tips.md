### How to undo a Git commit that was not pushed

1. ## Undo commit and keep all files staged (already `git add`)

    ```
    git reset --soft HEAD~;
    ```

2. ## Undo commit and unstage all files (*not include* `git add`)
    ```
    git reset HEAD~;
    ```

3. ## Undo the commit and completely remove all changes
    ```
    git reset --hard HEAD~;
    ```
